# Evolutionary SVM Kernel Selection

This is a simple piece of code to implement evolutionary polynomial kernel selection for an SVM. This project is for fun, and does not show any significant performance improvements.

This was created without consulting relevant literature, and may have glaring issues to those more familiar with evolutionary processes.
